# MagicPuddle OS - *Keep It Simple Stupid*

*MPOS* is an x64 based Linux distro built for barebone machines. We customized [Arch](https://archlinux.org/) [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux "Arch Linux Home Page") the least amount of obfuscation and/or deviation from the [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php "Arch Linux Wiki Page") [installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide "Arch Linux Installation Guide") guide and is therefore logical or for ease of use. Sym links to default locations for example. The minimalist build approach uses only the most direct simplified framework to build your experience.
